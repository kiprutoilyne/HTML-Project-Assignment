        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p> The earliest record we have of ragu alla bolognese does come from a nineteenth-century cookbook describing
            it as the wholesome dish most commonly served in Bologna. Comprised of soft tagliatelle noodles covered with
            a slow-cooked vegetable and meat ragu, bolognese was a simply made and incredibly tender one-pot meal that
            became an instant trend.
        <p>
            Spaghetti bolognese (sometimes called spaghetti alla bolognese) is a pasta dish that is popular outside
            Italy.It consists of spaghetti served with a sauce made from tomatoes, minced beef, garlic, wine and herbs;
            sometimes minced beef can be replaced by other minced meats.
        <p>The dish is often served with grated Parmesan on top, but local cheeses, such as grated cheddar are also
            often used. It may be served with a larger proportion of sauce to pasta than is common in Italian spaghetti
            dishes. The sauce may be laid on top of the pasta (rather than being mixed in, in the Italian manner) or
            even served separately from it, leaving diners to mix it in themselves.</p>
